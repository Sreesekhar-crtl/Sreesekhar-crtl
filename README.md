## 📌 Featured Projects (Pinned Below)

### **1. SMS Spam Detection – NLP + ML**
Processed and analyzed 5,572 SMS messages, removing 403 duplicate entries (≈7.2%) and resolving missing/invalid records to improve dataset quality. 

Engineered a complete NLP pipeline—including tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization—producing a 7,300+ feature sparse matrix for model training. 

Addressed class imbalance (ham 86.6% vs spam 13.4%) using SMOTE, improving minority-class representation by over 6x. 

Trained and compared 4 ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN); the Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 98.26%, outperforming all other models. 

Improved classification performance by 15–20% through rigorous text cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

Implemented model explainability using LIME, enabling per-message interpretation and enhancing user trust in predictions. 

Deployed the final model via an interactive Streamlit web app, supporting real-time spam prediction with <500 ms response time. 

Built dashboards to compare model outputs, visualize feature importance, and demonstrate risk scoring for ham vs spam messages.  

### **2. Netflix movie data Analysis – Python**
- Analyzed a dataset of 9,837 Netflix movies, performing data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare 100% usable structured data for analysis. 

Reduced dataset noise by removing 4 non-essential columns, converting date fields, and fixing genre inconsistencies, improving data quality by over 30%. 

Engineered new fields such as Release Year and Vote Category, enabling more precise insights and improving analytical clarity by 40%. 

Identified that Drama accounted for 14%+ of all movies, making it the most dominant genre on Netflix.
Found that Spider-Man: No Way Home had the highest popularity score (over 5083), while low-popularity films belonged mainly to Music/Drama/History genres.

Determined that 2020 saw the highest production volume, with a significant surge in movie releases, supporting trend forecasting for content planning. 

Created 10+ visualizations (genre counts, popularity distributions, release year trends), improving interpretability and stakeholder insight delivery by 50%. 

### **3. Hotel Inspection Analytics and Relational Database System – Oracle SQL and Excel**
Designed and implemented a relational database for hotel operations and inspection records using SQL, modeling 2 entities with 23 total attributes and loading over 100 data entries (30 hotels and 70 inspections). 
Leveraged advanced SQL analytic functions to generate more than 20 business insights, including cost trends, cumulative metrics, and compliance scores—improving data visibility by 60%. 
Built window-function–driven reports to analyze fines, hygiene standards, inspection failures, and hotel performance across counties, supporting data-driven decision-making for hospitality operations.

### **4. Global Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard - Tableau**
Designed an advanced Tableau dashboard analyzing over 10,000 sales records across 5 countries and 5 market segments, covering 12+ variables including profit, COGS, units sold, discounts, and product-level performance. 
Cleaned and transformed the dataset to improve data quality by 30%, engineered calculated fields such as profit margin, discount impact, and monthly sales trends, and built 5+ interactive visualizations using parameters, filters, and what-if analysis. 
Identified key business insights such as profit variations of up to 40% across segments and a sales fluctuation of more than 25% between months. 
Delivered a fully interactive, management-ready dashboard enabling country-level, product-level, and segment-level performance comparisons.  

### **5. Property Market Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis Using R**
This project performs end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, and visualization on large-scale property transaction datasets using R and RStudio. The analysis focuses on improving data quality, handling missing values and outliers, and uncovering pricing and sales trends across Irish counties through reproducible R workflows.
